🎮 **Pokemon Game Simulation - C++ Term Project**

## 📌 About the Project
This project is a Pokémon-themed game simulation developed in C++ to implement **Object Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles.

Users can log in as **players** or **admins**. Players can encounter random Pokémon and choose to fight, catch, or escape. Admins can update system data (Pokémon, moves, users, pokeballs).

## 🧪 Used OOP Concepts
- **Inheritance**
- **Composition**
- **Abstract Class**
- **Modular Programming**

## 🕹️ Player Features
- List and manage Pokémon
- Explore and encounter Pokémon
- Attack with moves
- Throw pokeballs
- Escape and return to menu
- Log out

## 🔧 Admin Features
- Manage Pokémon, moves, pokeballs, and users
- Add/delete/update data
- Save changes to `.txt` files

## 📄 File Descriptions
- `pokemons.txt`: Pokémon data (Name, HP, Attack, Defense, Speed)
- `moves.txt`: Moves data (Name, Power)
- `pokeballs.txt`: Ball catch rates (Name, Catch Rate)
- `users.txt`: Users' credentials and roles

## ⚠️ Notes & Rules
- Players must have 1–6 Pokémon
- Each Pokémon has 4 random moves
- Players start with 3 Pokémon and 3 basic balls
- Input is validated to prevent crashes
- Code is commented and clean

## 📈 Evaluation Criteria
- Complete and bug-free functionality
- Proper use of OOP principles
